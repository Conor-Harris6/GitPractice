(Not necessarily my favorite but a pretty good movie (all I can think of right now)): About Time

About Time is a story about how some members of a particular family have the ability to go back in time to moments of their own lives and alter things
The lead is Domhnall Gleeson and the movie would likely be categorized as a romantic comedy.
The ending has a nice message that has stuck with me in the years since watching it, so I recommend it.
